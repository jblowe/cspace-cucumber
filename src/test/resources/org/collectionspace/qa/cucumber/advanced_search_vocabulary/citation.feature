Feature: Advanced Search - Citation 

## The remainder of this feature file, below, needs to be converted from narrative to steps
#
# Scenario 1: Advanced Search Fields
#
#     Actions:
#         Create a new Citation record
#         Fill in the following fields:
#         Display Name (remember what you entered)
#         Full Citation
#         Language
#         Status
#         Term Type
#         Title
#         Save the record
#         Print out the record to remember what you entered in each field
#         Navigate to advanced search via the link next to the search field in the upper right hand corner
#         Select Citation in the record type drop down
#         Enter what you previously entered into the Display Name field in the record, into the Display Name field in Advanced Search
#         Click search
#
#     Expected:
#         The Citation record you just created should appear in the search results
#
#     Actions:
#         Do this for each of the fields listed above, field by field, by erasing / un-selecting the value you entered into the previous field, and entering the value in the next field.
#     Expected:
#         The Citation record you just created should appear in the search results
#
#     Actions:
#         Search the Record Last Modified By field for your username (e.g. admin@core.collectionspace.org)
#     Expected:
#         The Citation record you just created should appear in the search results
#
#     Actions:
#         Search the Modified Date field for today's date
#     Expected:
#         The Citation record you just created should appear in the search results
#         (Note, 2/2016: Be aware of the way that Collectionspace handles the time difference between your location and UTC. I last modified a record on 2016-02-04T20:17:36:927 PST, but CSpace recorded the modification at 2016-02-05T00:17:36:927Z, i.e., just after midnight the next day. An advanced search on modified date - latest date February 4, 2016 does not detect the record. This is expected CSpace behavior, though confusing to users, perhaps. - Rick)
